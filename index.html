     7 Questions To Help Decide If LearnDash Is The Right Platform For You</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 1%;">A Learning Management System which offers you more control over content planning & delivery and learner engagement helps deliver robust learning solutions. 
    With e-learners on the rise, how you engage with them is just as imperative as your content. Also, learner engagement and content delivery needs vary from course to course and across Organizations. 
    In this post, we look at the key factors you must consider in order to decide if LearnDash will support your business needs. 
    <p style="margin-left: 1%;">
    <h5 style="margin-left: 1%;">1. How easy is it to design courses? </h5>
    <p style="margin-left: 1%;">Imagine building multi-layered courses with a simple drag & drop! With LearnDash, you can
      <ul>   <li> Create effective courses with gamification, micro-content, social learning, and advanced quizzing. </li>
    <li> Make it exceptional with any WordPress theme, and any media (image, audio, video, SWF, HTML5 & more). </li>
    <li> Include a Gradebook, customized Certificate, and Course completion points. 
    More importantly, it allows you to reuse your content and spin-up courses. That's scalability with minimal effort! This exclusive feature makes LearnDash a powerful course builder. </li>
  </ul>
  <h5 style="margin-left: 1%;">2. Are the courses accessible on mobile devices? </h5>

    
   <p style="margin-left: 1%;"> LearnDash is designed for on-the-go learning. 

    The courses you offer can be accessed on tablets, smartphones, and other mobile devices in addition to desktops and laptops. So you can simply focus on course creation. </p>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 1%;">3. How easy is it to customize?  </h5>

    <p style="margin-left: 1%;"> We've told you how you can create courses in a jiffy with LearnDash. Better yet, its robust framework enables ease of customization for extension development as well. So your unique business needs can be supported with add-ons. 
    You can choose from a range of free, premium, and 3rd party plugins. For instance, create segmented email lists for courses, allow multiple course instructors, or add membership to courses. 

    <h5 style="margin-left: 1%;"> 4. How easy is it to administer?  </h5>

   
    <p style="margin-left: 1%;"> Need to group users for efficient management? View a learner's progress? Revoke a learner's access to a course? Approve an assignment?
    You can do all of the above and much more with LearnDash! Simply put, you have more control over your courses AND learners. 
    <h5 style="margin-left: 1%;"> 5. How can it improve learner engagement?  </h5>

   
    <p style="margin-left: 1%;"> LearnDash offers an optional Focus mode that helps eliminate distraction which in turn helps improve learner retention and completion rates. 
    For a guided learning experience, you can avail the Drip-Feed feature which is useful to schedule content across different time intervals. Learn more about this here. 
    With flexible prerequisites, learners have the freedom to create their learning path. Engagement can also happen over dynamic forums created for individual courses. 
    <h5 style="margin-left: 1%;">6. Does it support standard payment gateways? </h5>

    
    <p style="margin-left: 1%;"> LearnDash supports PayPal, Stripe, and 2Checkout out of the box. You can integrate a Shopping Cart which can support many other payment gateways.
    <h5 style="margin-left: 1%;">7. What is the selling model for the courses? </h5>
 
    
    <p style="margin-left: 1%;"> You design the course, you decide how to sell! LearnDash allows for one-time purchase, recurring payments/subscriptions, course membership or traditional membership. You can even create course bundles and offer free samples of the course for optimized promotion. 
    <h5 style="margin-left: 1%;">    In Conclusion 
    </h5>

    <p style="margin-left: 1%;"> LearnDash has been a game-changer in the e-Learning and Publishing industries helping harness the power of an LMS without the usual hassles associated with setting one up.

  <div class="container" style="margin-left: 1%;">
      <h1 class="" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 5%;">Sample Book Review</h2>
  </div>
  <h5 style="margin-left: 1%;">  About The Author </h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 1%;">Dr Brian Weiss is a psychiatrist who lives and practices in Miami, Florida. Weiss — a graduate of Yale Medical School — initially distrusted anything that science couldn’t prove. However, his thinking changed after a peculiar case of one of his patients who didn’t recover through traditional therapy. Through this book, he chronicles his understanding of life and death and the mysteries of the mind. He
    has also written several other international bestsellers. Only Love is Real, Messages from the Masters, Same Soul, Many Bodies, & Through Time into Healing are all groundbreaking. 
    <h5 style="margin-left: 1%;">Synopsis</h5>
     
    <p style="margin-left: 1%;">A strange pull towards a person one just met! Repeated friction or trust issues with someone. Insufferable physical pain or trauma even after getting treated by the best physicians. It makes a good case for wonder, doesn’t it? 
    Many Lives, Many Masters reveals how one’s past life experiences influence the present behavior. 
    What one terms “energy”, “vibe”, or “wavelength” is not an instantaneous response to a person or a surrounding or an event. It is in fact a response triggered by memories of one’s life from as far as the past life. These memories are stored in the subconscious. 
    So then, is past-life/life after death true? The author, himself a skeptic of the idea initially, says that his remarkable learnings from the case prove it to be true. He also notes that science could take a while to decipher the underlying working. But collective experiences from several people point to life after death — there’s no death. 
    But what happens between lives? The book explains this through the concept of “Spirits” and “Master Spirits” surrounding us. 
    <h5 style="margin-left: 1%;"> What We Liked About Many Lives, Many Masters </h5>
    
    <p style="margin-left: 1%;">The book makes the reader prod how much more simple life could be if they didn’t fear death. If they knew that life goes on also means, in some way, that life is endless. That what goes around does come around. That balance and harmony are vital to one’s existence. That the soul needs to be nourished with love, empathy and kindness. That getting rid of one’s vices is crucial. Simple reminders that seem more powerful as messages from the beyond. 
    The book offers detailed explanation on what happens just after physical death, in between lives, and why and when the next life starts. Reincarnation is true affirms the author. It’s interesting to read on how Spirits supposedly communicate with human beings. 
    Guardian angels exist, says the book. It’s hard not to wonder if this is a fantasy novel. Yet that this is a true story makes it a compelling read. 
    The regression sessions described offer plenty of scope for the mind to imagine and that is what makes it tug at one’s heart. 
    <h5 style="margin-left: 1%;"> What We Did Not Like About Many Lives, Many Masters </h5>
   
    <p style="margin-left: 1%;">The chronicles on the hypnosis sessions seem too many sometimes. Therefore, it leads to thinking whether this is a work of fiction. The explanation on the stages of a soul in between lives is scattered which leads to a lack of clarity on the same. However, these are conveyed through conversations
    happening at different episodes of hypnosis and so it cannot be expected to be outlined altogether as pointers. 
    
    <h5 style="margin-left: 1%;">Rating: 4.5/5 </h5>
    <p style="margin-left: 1%;">The book is a quick, easy and thought-provoking read for anyone interested in knowing what happens after death (what is death even?). It reflects on how to lead a more harmonious life. Reading this leaves one with a renewed perspective of human connections.

    <h4 style="margin-left: 1%;"><u>Fun Facts/Titbits: </u>

    </h4>

    <p style="margin-left: 1%;"> Cap 1: Do you know the official color for the weddings this winter? It’s Red! No wonder then that Aishwarya Rai was seen at a family wedding in a gorgeous red ensemble! Cricketer Zaheer Khan’s wife, actor Sagarika Ghatge too looked resplendent in a red saree at their wedding! So whether you’re a
      bride-to-be, the maid of honor, one of the bridesmaids or simply a guest at a wedding, make sure to add a lot of red to your ensemble, this winter! 
      <p style="margin-left: 1%;"> Cap 2: Hello folks, at Kingdom of Beer, we care for you very much! That’s why we’d never let you suffer from Cenosillicaphobia! Wondering what that is?? Let me tell you then! It is the fear of an empty beer glass! We would never want to put you through that! So just ask and we’ll refill your glass! 
        <p style="margin-left: 1%;"> Cap 3: Here’s a fun fact we bet you didn’t know about pens! On average, a pen can write approximately 45,000 words. We’re sure you’d agree that one couldn’t type that many words on a phone without its battery draining out! And that’s why pens can never lose their charm even in the digital era! 
          <p style="margin-left: 1%;">Cap 4: Snacking on nuts is good for your heart because it can lower the levels of bad cholesterol! Nuts are also rich in heart-healthy substances such as unsaturated fats, fiber, Vitamin E and Omega-3 Fatty Acids. So we could agree that the heart wants what it wants; we mean nuts!
